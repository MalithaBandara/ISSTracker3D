       <p><b><u>Early 1950s</u></b></p><p>American space pioneer Wernher von Braun already had ideas for large orbiting space stations. He envisioned a wheel-shaped facility, slowly rotating to provide artificial gravity to its several thousand occupants.

      <p><b><u>1958</u></b></p><p>Shortly after its founding, NASA began considering more modest space stations.</p>
     
     <h2 class="milestone">1960-1970</h2>
     <p><b><u>1969/u></b></u></p><p> The Space Task Group (STG) that President Richard M. Nixon commissioned in 1969 to assess post-Apollo space objectives proposed an Earth-orbiting space station for the mid-1970s followed later by a much larger space base among several other projects.</p>

      <h2 class="milestone">1970-1980</h2>
     <p><b><u>1972</u></b></p>  <p>President Nixon approved the Space Shuttle, the only STG-recommended project to receive funding.
      </p>
<p><b><u>1973-1974</u></b></p><p>In the meantime, the highly-successful experimental space station Skylab flew in 1973-4 using leftover Apollo hardware.</p>

      <h2 class="milestone">1980-1990</h2>
      <p><b><u>1984</u></b></p><p>State of the Union address to Congress, President Ronald W. Reagan directed NASA to develop a “permanently manned space station and to do it within a decade.” His comments reflected his view of American pre-eminence in space but explicitly stated that the United States would invite other nations to join in the project and spelled out the benefits to be derived from such an orbiting platform
</p> <img src="imgs/P4.jpg" height="300" width="300">
      <p><b><u>1985</u></b></p><p> NASA established a Space Station Program Office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p> <img src="imgs/P5.jpg" height="300" width="300">
      <p><b><u>1986</u></b></p><p> the Soviet Union operated its Mir space station beginning with the launch of its first module</p> <img src="imgs/P6.jpg" height="300" width="300">
      <p><b><u>1988</u></b></p><p>  President Reagan announced that the orbital facility would be called Space Station Freedom, and two months later the Unites States, Japan, Canada and nine ESA member states signed an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) for its construction and utilization.</p>
 <img src="imgs/P7.jpg" height="300" width="300">
      <h2 class="milestone">1990-2000</h2>
      <p><b><u>1993</u></b></p><p> President William J. “Bill” Clinton invited Russia to join the program as a full partner, essentially adding modules planned for Mir-2 to US, European, Japanese, and Canadian elements from Space Station Freedom. The new outpost would be called International Space Station (ISS).</p> <img src="imgs/P8.jpg" height="300" width="300">
<p><b><u>1995-1998</u></b></p><p>In preparation for ISS operations, between 1995 and 1998 seven US astronauts joined Russian cosmonauts as long-duration residents aboard Mir, with Space Shuttles providing transportation and resupply logistics.</p><p>
<b><u>1998.01.29</u></b></p><p> representatives from the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada and participating ESA countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and The United Kingdom) met at the US State Department in Washington, DC, and signed an updated IGA on Space Station Cooperation. The modifications to the 1988 agreement were made necessary largely by the decision to include Russia in the partnership. The new IGA established the overall cooperative framework for the design, development, operation and utilization of ISS and addressed several legal topics, including civil and criminal jurisdiction, intellectual property and the operational responsibilities of the participating partners.</p><img src="imgs/P9.jpg" height="300" width="300"><p><b><u>10 months after the signing the Russians launched the Zarya module</u></b></p><p>

 The first American element, the Unity Node 1 module, arrived via Space Shuttle Endeavour three weeks later, beginning the construction of the largest international space platform.</p><img src="imgs/P11.jpg" height="300" width="300">
